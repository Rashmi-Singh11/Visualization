# Sorting Visualizer

A **Sorting Visualizer** is a web-based application that visually demonstrates the workings of popular sorting algorithms. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project allows users to interact with various sorting algorithms and observe how they process and organize data step by step.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**
  - Adjustable array size.
  - Adjustable sorting speed.
  - Buttons to start, pause, resume, and restart sorting.

- **Supported Sorting Algorithms**
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Real-Time Visualization**
  - Dynamic bar heights represent array values.
  - Color-coded bars indicate comparisons, swaps, and sorted elements:
    - **Yellow:** Pivot element or key being evaluated.
    - **Red:** Current elements being compared.
    - **Green:** Sorted elements.
    - **Blue:** Unscrutinized elements.

## How It Works

1. The application generates a random array of numbers.
2. Users can select the array size and sorting speed.
3. The chosen sorting algorithm processes the array while visually representing each step of the sorting process.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
